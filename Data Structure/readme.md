### p1 - Slice list into 3 equal chunks and reverse each chunk
<br>

Input: non-empty list<br>
Output: list slice into 3 equal chunks and each chunk is reversed order <br><br>

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89] | [8, 45, 11] [12, 14, 23] [89, 45, 78] |

#

### P2 - Count the occurrence of each element from a list
<br>

Input: non-empty list.<br>
Output: count of list elements in dictionary

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89] | {8: 1, 11: 2, 45: 3, 23: 2, 89: 1} |
#

### P3 - Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
<br>

Input: non-empty list contains tuples<br>
Output: list contains tuples and each tuple is the last element-wise sorted list

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)] | [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)] |

#

### P4 -  Find the intersection (common) of two sets and remove those elements from the first set.
 <br>


Input: give two sets, set1 and set2<br>
Output: two sets in which first set contains intersection between two given sets and second set contains first set without intersection value of two give set

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| {23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, 29} | {57, 83, 29} {65, 42, 78, 23} |
| {57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, 48} |
#

### P5 - Sort given array of three random elements. 0,1 & 2. Without any sorting algorithm. Time complexity: O(n)
<br>

Input: non-empty list contains 0,1,2 multiple times<br>
Output: output as a sorted list without using sorted algorithm

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [1,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,0] | [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]  |
